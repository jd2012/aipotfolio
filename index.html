			<h2>Waze Traffic Calculator</h2>
			<h4>Travel Times for Peoria, IL</h4>
			<p>Travel times and traffic information are a vital part of many commuters morning routine and a staple of any local news station's morning show. So when my friend, who is a meteorologist on a morning news show, mentioned that she reports traffic by looking up travel times on Waze, I was suprised.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> I had always imagined that news stations got traffic data from different sources than the public. It makes sense to use Waze, however, considering the app calculates travel times from crowd sourced data. </span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('waze')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jd2012.github.io/Waze-Traffic-Calculator/">Check it out</a></p>

			<h2>No Child Left Behind - Heatstroke Prevention Carseat</h2>
			<p>If you have ever gotten into a car thats been out in the sun on a summer day, you know that the interior can get extremely hot. The interior of a car can actually reach 40 degrees above the outside temperature in just 30 mins, bringing the interior to 130º on a 90º F day. This can create extremely deadly situations, especially when children are involved. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">A child can die when their body temperature reaches just 107 degrees. In 2022, 33 children died of heatstroke in vehicles, and all of them were preventable. Growing up in SoCal, where its pretty much always sunny, this was a year-round problem. Thats why, for my senior year engineering capstone project, I partnered with two of my classmates to create a car seat that could help prevent pediatric vehicular heatstroke.
			Using a Bluetooth enabled Arduino and weight sensors from a bathroom scale, we created a working prototype that connected to an smartphone application. When there was a certain amount of weight in the carseat and the phone moved away from the carseat or the Bluetooth signal was lost, the user got a notification on their device reminding them to check the backseat. As I was in charge of the programing, I learned a great deal about iOS application development and Apple protocols  and development in general. In hindsight, choosing to build an iOS application rather than an Android application most likely made the project exponentially more difficult, as we had to deal with Apple's security protocols. There were also parts of the project that could definitely been improved. The Bluetooth connection was often unreliable and the weight sensor constantly needed to be reset. We  even explored creating an OBDII dongle to confirm that the car was stopped before sending an alert to reduce the chance of false positives.</span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('heatstroke')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a></p>

			<h2>Family Cabin Website</h2>
			<p>I love the mountains. The fresh air, peace and quiet, surrounded by nature. Luckily my dad’s family has a cabin on Forest Service land that has all that. So naturally, I love spending time there. But so does my extended family, which is fine… except I have 60+ relatives on that side.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Which makes sharing the cabin a bit of a logistical nightmare. As the family keeps expanding as the kids get married and have their own kids, the need for a centralized place to reserve the cabin and see its availability has increased. If only there was someone in the family that had the skills to create a website… Oh, wait.
			I created the site using PHP and MySQL and hosting it off of my RaspberryPi locally. There is a reservation page where you can book the cabin if it available on those dates and a newsletter page for family news and events. On the calendar page, you can see when it is available and a tooltip pops up on mouseover with information on who has reserved the cabin. Because it is on Forest Service land, we can not rent it out and could lose the permit if the Service interprets this website as an VRBO-esque site. Therefore the majority of the site is password protected, which was a challenge for me. I had never built an account creation or sign in form with validation and security. The majority of the site is completed but it still has a long ways to come before it is ready for the technically challenged.</span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('cabin')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a></p>
