			<h2>Waze Traffic Calculator</h2>
			<h4>Travel Times for Peoria, IL</h4>
			<p>Travel times and traffic information are a vital part of many commuters morning routine and a staple of any local news station's morning show. So when my friend, who is a meteorologist on a morning news show, mentioned that she reports traffic by looking up travel times on Waze, I was suprised<span class="dots">... </span><span class="more">. I had always imagined that news stations got traffic data from different sources than the public. It makes sense to use Waze, considering the app calculates travel times by aggregating crowd-sourced data, meaning the more people using the app, the more accurate the results. 
			My friend continued on to say that in order to update the graphics for the show, she had to copy and paste the results of each route into either an Excel sheet or a CSV file. This task became very repetitive throughout the three-hour show, and she wanted me to automate it. So I dove right in.
			The goal was to create a program that outputs, in an easily exportable format, the travel times for all the different routes simultaneously. First, I needed to be able to get the travel data from Waze. Unfortunately, Waze is pretty stingy about who gets access to their SDK, so I couldn't get direct access to the data. Luckily, I found a Python extension that pulls data from Waze and gets travel times for a singular route. I also discovered an extension for Excel called xlwings. This extension allowed me to run a python script and VBA macros right from an open Excel document. With some implementation and modification, I created a program that got travel times, inserted them into an Excel sheet, and exported a CSV file, initiated by a button on that same Excel sheet. Thats it!… or so I thought. When I presented it to my friend, she reminded me that her account privileges would not let her install xlwings. So, it was back to the drawing board.
			I needed a way to run Python and do file manipulation online, but I didn't want to pay for a premium hosting site. After an extensive search and lots of dead ends, I came across Repl.it, a multi-language online IDE. Repl.it not only allowed me to run the Python program, it let me export as a CSV. To make it even easier to export, I updated the program to output all the times simultaneously and have more format options and embedded it on a webpage hosted on Github. My friend was very grateful and used it every day, until she moved a month later. </span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('waze')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://jd2012.github.io/Waze-Traffic-Calculator/">Check it out</a></p>

			<h2>Gunshot Detection System</h2>
			<p>During my time at Parkland College, I helped found the Engineering Club.  Our main goal was to give students at the community college more opportunities, knowledge, and resources in engineering. We hosted workshops on anything from C++ to soldering and guest speakers from various engineering disciplines. But the majority of our time was spent on club projects, where everyone would contribute their knowledge and teach the rest of the club in the process. The biggest one of these projects was the Gunshot Detection System<span class="dots">... </span><span class="more">. 
			Living in America means most students are unfortunately very familiar with school shootings. One thing that we noticed was the lack of data first responders have when entering such an event. In a situation where seconds could mean life or death for a student, police are often slowed by the unknowns. They have to systematically clear the building until they find the shooter. But what if police already knew exactly where the shots are coming from as they pull up to the scene? The purpose of the Gunshot Detection System is to detect gunshots fired inside buildings and determine the location of the shots through triangulation.
			We decided to start by modifying a clap switch circut from analog to digital output so we could assign a numerical value to the volume of the sound. We then connected the circut to an Arduino to log our results. We went through multiple rounds of testing, increasing the resistance in the circut until our readings were consistent. Unfortunately, the pandemic prevented us from ever meeting up again, so we were unable to continue test. We did, however, continue to discuss, troubleshoot, and theorize different aspects of the project throughout the rest of the semester. <a href="https://parkland-engineering-club.github.io/Homepage/">Check out the club site and repositories</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('gunshot')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a></p>

			<h2>No Child Left Behind - Heatstroke Prevention Carseat</h2>
			<p>If you have ever gotten into a car thats been out in the sun on a summer day, you know that the interior can get extremely hot. The interior of a car can actually reach 40 degrees above the outside temperature in just 30 mins, bringing the interior to 130º on a 90º F day. This can create extremely deadly situations, especially when children are involved<span class="dots">... </span><span class="more">. A child can die when their body temperature reaches just 107 degrees. In 2022, 33 children died of heatstroke in vehicles, and all of them were preventable. Growing up in SoCal, where its pretty much always sunny, this was a year-round problem. Thats why, for my senior year engineering capstone project, I partnered with two of my classmates to create a car seat that could help prevent pediatric vehicular heatstroke.
			Using a Bluetooth enabled Arduino and weight sensors from a bathroom scale, we created a working prototype that connected to an smartphone application. When there was a certain amount of weight in the carseat and the phone moved away from the carseat or the Bluetooth signal was lost, the user got a notification on their device reminding them to check the backseat. As I was in charge of the programing, I learned a great deal about iOS application development and Apple protocols  and development in general. In hindsight, choosing to build an iOS application rather than an Android application most likely made the project exponentially more difficult, as we had to deal with Apple's security protocols. There were also parts of the project that could definitely been improved. The Bluetooth connection was often unreliable and the weight sensor constantly needed to be reset. We  even explored creating an OBDII dongle to confirm that the car was stopped before sending an alert to reduce the chance of false positives. </span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('heatstroke')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NKN-Engineering">Check out the repositories</a></p>

			<h2>Family Cabin Website</h2>
			<p>I love the mountains. The fresh air, peace and quiet, surrounded by nature. Luckily my dad's family has a cabin on Forest Service land that has all that. So naturally, I love spending time there. But so does my extended family, which is fine… except I have 60+ relatives on that side<span class="dots">... </span><span class="more">. Which makes sharing the cabin a bit of a logistical nightmare. As the family keeps expanding as the kids get married and have their own kids, the need for a centralized place to reserve the cabin and see its availability has increased. If only there was someone in the family that had the skills to create a website… Oh, wait.
			I created the site using PHP and MySQL and hosting it off of my RaspberryPi locally. There is a reservation page where you can book the cabin if it available on those dates and a newsletter page for family news and events. On the calendar page, you can see when it is available and a tooltip pops up on mouseover with information on who has reserved the cabin. Because it is on Forest Service land, we can not rent it out and could lose the permit if the Service interprets this website as an VRBO-esque site. Therefore the majority of the site is password protected, which was a challenge for me. I had never built an account creation or sign in form with validation and security. The majority of the site is completed but it still has a long ways to come before it is ready for the technically challenged. </span><a href="#" onclick="readMore('cabin')" class="moreBtn">Read more</a></p>
